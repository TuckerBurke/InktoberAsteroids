# InktoberAsteroids
## About
Inktober Asteroids is an Asteroids clone with hand animated assets. Uses A, S, D, W for movement and SPACE to fire missles. You can download the build [here](ProjectFiles/Builds/InktoberAsteroids.zip) if you would like to play.
## Documentation
I created this game for my Interactive Media Development course at RIT. This was my first project assembled in Unity and was coded using C#. The sprites were hand drawn with ink on tracing papaer for Inktober. The purpose of the assignment was to utilize vector forces for controls and physics. I plan to return to this project at some point to flesh it out as a juicy, fully functional game with levels, upgrades, and more.
